		<h2>Hi, I'm Steven Haun.</h2>
		<p>
		   Thanks for visiting. 
		   <br />Life is big, but here is the taster platter.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<p>
			I'm born and raised 4th generation Texan, but I've been all over the world thanks to the generosity of many kind kind people.<br />
			I really enjoy Italy and the islands of Greece and I have some cool pictures in the 'Art' section of the site.  I've also been to Australia, Serbia, Hungary, Germany, Brussels and Luxembourg (is that really a country?).
		</p>
		<hr />
		<p>
			In my professional life I started writing web sites and learning Photoshop when I was 12.  My parents supported this (they are awesome), though they did not understand what it all was.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<p>
			I graduated with honors from the wonderful Red McCombs School of Business at UT Austin.
			While in Austin I worked for a high-tech optical company called Graftek Imaging working under the genius Italian Physicist Giuseppi Cima (Pepi).
		</p>
		<hr />
		<p>
			Upon graduation I took a job in Dallas with a high end IT Consulting company called Pariveda Solutions where I worked for 5 years on many projects ranging from startups to billion dollar enterprise systems.  It was great experience and I worked with some really smart people there.  Much gratitude.
			<hr />
			Looking to sharpen my front-end skills I followed a manager to a small digital agency called Imaginuity Interactive Inc. where I worked with some extraordinary front end developers and designers.  At Imaginuity I really began to sharpen my CSS and JavaScript skills to a new level and eventually managed a team of about 8 people.
			<hr />
			Then, a friend of mine, Michael Sparks, called me and asked if I wanted to come work at a high tech healthcare startup called Catapult Health, so I joined him there.  Catapult is a very cool, progressive company in the healthcare space that empowers individuals to improve their health via real-time diagnostic screenings.
			<hr />
		</p>
		<hr />
		<p>
			In addition to tech work I also like to practice Yoga, Chi Gong, various artistic disciplines and hang out with my wonderful wife.
		</p>
